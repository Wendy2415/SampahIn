    <string name="descResult">Waste Paper refers to paper that has already been used or discarded paper that no longer has immediate value in its original form and is typically thrown away or recycled. This type of paper can come from various sources such as newspapers, office paper, packaging, and other types of paper used in daily life.\n\nCharacteristics of Waste Paper:\nSources: Waste paper comes from various sources, including households, offices, industries, and schools. Some types of waste paper are easier to recycle, such as newspaper or printed paper, while others may be more difficult due to contamination with ink or chemicals.\n\nTypes of Waste Paper:\n\nNewspaper: Paper used for newspapers and other printed media.\nPrinted and Writing Paper: Usually paper used in offices, such as printer paper or regular writing paper.\nPackaging Paper: Paper used for wrapping or packaging products, such as cardboard and carton packaging.\nCoated Paper: Paper made with a layer of plastic or other materials that make it more difficult to recycle.\nRecycling: Waste paper is a primary raw material in the paper recycling industry.
